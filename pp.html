						Question : Bias in police stops?
					</h3>
					Concerns:
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							In the late 1990s, concerns were raised across US about police harassment of minority groups.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Allegedly, police were stopping people on the highways for <strong>driving while black</strong>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Racial bias in pedestrian stops of citizens in the name of <strong>zero-tolerance</strong> policies to control quality-of-life crimes.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="fragment">
						These practices prompted angry reactions among minority citizens.

					<h3>
						Why NYPD?
					</h3>
					<div class="fragment">
						New York City&rsquo;s policing strategy, during the 1990s, involved aggressive stops and searches of pedestrians for a wide range of crimes.

						&ldquo;Temporarily detaining, questioning, and, at times, searching civilians on the street&rdquo;.

					<h4>
						Previous Approaches:
					</h4>
					Here is a list of conclusions/outcomes from past studies:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Two nationwide surveys ('99 & '02) showed that African-Americans were far more likely than others to report being stopped on the highways.
						</li>
						<li>
							Minority drivers also were more likely to report being ticketed, arrested, handcuffed, or searched.
						</li>
						<li>
							Another approach is to compare "hit-rates" between different ethnic groups, i.e., proportion of stops that yield positive results.
							<br>
							But this bypasses the quiestion whether police <strong>intend</strong> to discriminate, instead focuses on the <strong>disparate impacts</strong>.
						</li>
						<li>
							In 2001, a study showed that of the drivers on I-95 in Maryland stopped on suspicion of drug trafficking, African-Americans were as likely as whites to have drugs in their cars.

					<h3>
						Data Collection
					</h3>
					Information was collated for all stops from January 1998 through March 1999.
					About 175,000 stops were recorded in that period.
					<br>
					<span class="fragment">
						The police are not required to fill out a form for every stop.
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								$72\%$ mandated cases
							</li>
							<li>
								$28\%$ non-mandated (reporting was optional)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span class="fragment">The form has one field: <strong>“Factors which caused officer to reasonably suspect person stopped (include information from third persons and their identity, if known).”</strong></span>
					<br>
					<span class="fragment">
						These forms and the reasons for the stops were examined for a citywide sample of 5,000 cases, along with 10,869 others, representing 50% of the cases in a nonrandom sample of 8 of the 75 police precincts.
					</span>

					<h3>
						Data Collection : Examples
					</h3>
					<div class="r-stack">
						<div class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="3">
							Here are some examples that motivated police decisions to stop suspects:
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								“At TPO male was with person who fit description of person wanted for GLA [grand larceny auto] in 072 pct. log . . . upon approach male discarded small coin roller which contained 5 bags of alleged crack.”
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
								“Did have on a large bubble coat with a bulge in right pocket.”
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
								“Person stopped did stop walking and reverse direction upon seeing police. Attempted to enter store as police approached; Frisked for safety.”
							</blockquote>
						</div>
						<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
							The New York State Attorney General’s office used some rules to characterize the rationales of the stops.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Reasonable suspicion : $61\%$ <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">(1 in 7 led to arrest)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									Not reasonable : $15\%$ <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">(1 in 29 led to arrest)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									Insufficient information : $24\%$
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<br>
							<span>
								For Street Crimes Unit, 23% of stops were judged to not have a reasonable suspicion.
							</span>
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">
								<strong>There was no strong pattern by ethnicity here. The rate of unreasonable stops was about the same for all ethnic groups.</strong>
