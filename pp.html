						Question : Bias in police stops?
					</h3>
					Concerns:
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							In the late 1990s, concerns were raised across US about police harassment of minority groups.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Allegedly, police were stopping people on the highways for <strong>driving while black</strong>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Racial bias in pedestrian stops of citizens in the name of <strong>zero-tolerance</strong> policies to control quality-of-life crimes.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="fragment">
						These practices prompted angry reactions among minority citizens.

					<h3>
						Why NYPD?
					</h3>
					<div class="fragment">
						New York City&rsquo;s policing strategy, during the 1990s, involved aggressive stops and searches of pedestrians for a wide range of crimes.

						&ldquo;Temporarily detaining, questioning, and, at times, searching civilians on the street&rdquo;.

									Historically, close surveillance by police has been a part of everyday life for African-Americans.

									In 1996, court allowed the use of race as a basis for a police stop as long as there were other factors.

									The legal standard for police conduct sets some parameters for “reasonable suspicion”.

					<h4>
						Previous Approaches:
					</h4>
					Here is a list of conclusions/outcomes from past studies:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Two nationwide surveys ('99 & '02) showed that African-Americans were far more likely than others to report being stopped on the highways.
						</li>
						<li>
							Minority drivers also were more likely to report being ticketed, arrested, handcuffed, or searched.
						</li>
						<li>
							Another approach is to compare "hit-rates" between different ethnic groups, i.e., proportion of stops that yield positive results.
							<br>
							But this bypasses the quiestion whether police <strong>intend</strong> to discriminate, instead focuses on the <strong>disparate impacts</strong>.
						</li>
						<li>
							In 2001, a study showed that of the drivers on I-95 in Maryland stopped on suspicion of drug trafficking, African-Americans were as likely as whites to have drugs in their cars.

						Data Collection
					</h3>
					Information was collated for all stops from January 1998 through March 1999.
					About 175,000 stops were recorded in that period.

						The police are not required to fill out a form for every stop.
